# 2027 Cricket World Cup Winner Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses data science and machine learning techniques to predict the winner of the 2027 Cricket World Cup. By analyzing historical cricket match data, team performance metrics, and various match conditions, the model aims to forecast the potential outcomes of the tournament. This prediction model can help cricket analysts, fans, and stakeholders gain insights into team performance and make data-driven predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes historical cricket data, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
- **Feature Selection**: Extracts key features that impact match outcomes, such as team strengths, player stats, venue conditions, and recent form.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost to predict match results.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Acquired historical data on cricket matches, including player stats, team performance, venue conditions, etc.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Applied techniques like tokenization, missing value handling, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selected features crucial for predictions, such as recent form, team and player stats, and venue factors.
4. **Model Selection and Training**: Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) and tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
5. **Evaluation and Prediction**: Evaluated models on test data, chose the best model, and used it to predict outcomes for 2027 World Cup matches.
6. **Deployment**: (Optional) Deployed the model as a web app using Flask for real-time predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Flask (if deploying as a web app)
- matplotlib / seaborn (for data visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2027-cricket-world-cup-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script to train and test models:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
2. (Optional) Deploy the model as a Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Access the web app at `http://localhost:5000` to input match data and receive predictions.

## Results
This model achieved an accuracy of [X]% and an F1-score of [Y]% on test data. The project shows promising results in predicting match outcomes based on historical data and various game factors.
